# Alohomora-App
Web app that reads Spotify users' playlists and sorts them into Harry Potter Houses based on their music tastes. Only functional for registered testers on Spotify. Still need to request a quota extension from Spotify in order to be availible for public use. If you would like to be a tester, please email me at cuitorrance@gmail.com.
